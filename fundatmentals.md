What is Electrical Engineering?


### Fundamental Concepts:

What is Voltage (V)?                    Electrical potential difference between two points.
What is Current (I)?                    Flow of electric charge
What is Resistance (R)?                 Opposiion to the flow of current.
What is Power (P)?                      Rate at which electrical energy is transfered.
                                        Formula: P = V x I                  
                                        Measured in Watts (W)
### Ohm's Law:

What is Ohm's Law?                      Understanding how voltage, current and resistance relate to each other.
                                        Formula: V = I x R                  

What are Resistors?                     Limit Current (I) flow.
                                        Types: Fixed, Variable and Specialized.

What are Capacitors?                    Store electrical energy
                                        Types: Electrolytic, ceramic, and film capacitors

What are Inductors?                     Store energy in a magnetic field

What are Diodes?                        Allow current to flow in one direction only.

What are Transistors?                   Amplify or switch electronic signals.



### Circuits Analysis:

What are Series Circuits?               Same through all components, divided among components

What are Parallel Circuits?             Same across all components, divided among branches

What are Kirchhoff's Laws?              There are two types: KVL and KCL.
    KVL: Voltage Law:                   The sum of the electrical potential differences
    KCL: Current Law:                   The total current entering a junction equalsthe toal current leaving.



### AC vs DC:

What is Alternating Current?            Changes direction periodically; voltage varies.
What is Direct Current?                 Flows in one direction, constant voltage



### Electromagnetism Basics

What are Magnetic Fields:                       Produced by moving charges.
What is the Faraday's Law of Induction?         A changing magnetic field creates an electric current.

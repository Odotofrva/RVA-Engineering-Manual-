### Intro:

Setting up a development enviroment for C programming in embedded sysyems involes the following:
	
	- Selecting the right hardware
	- Installing software tools
	- Config your IDE ( if used )
	- Wriing and Testing Firmware




What is Linux?          An open-source Unix-like kernel, widely sed for it's stablity, security and flexiblity

Why use Linux?          
    - Open Source and Free to Use
    - Strong Community
    - ideal for dev enviroments for programming and system admin



### Install Linux:

To install, I used the option of WSL2 on Windows 11. This allows me to use Linux on a Windows machine.




### Installing GCC (GUN Compiler Collection)

Why?

Steps:
	- sudo apt update
	- sudo apt install build-essential


Verify Install:
	- gcc --version


For the IDE, many would recommend Platform IO or Keil MDK. I wanted to use the command line so that the coe wuld work for all types of development enviroments.



### Configuration of Projects:

- Create a new projet
- set compiler path
- add libraries for the hardware.


### Write a simple program


- Write a Hello World program using C.

### Compile and Upload

- Compile the program
- Upload to hardware
